🚗 RideCare – Smart Vehicle Service & Maintenance App

RideCare is a modern Android application designed to help vehicle owners track, manage, and book car maintenance services in a simple, intuitive way. The app centralizes vehicle data, service history, and repair requests into one clean, user-friendly interface.

It is built for everyday drivers who want better visibility, reliability, and control over their vehicle’s health.

📱 What RideCare Does

RideCare allows users to:

Register and manage their vehicle

View key vehicle information (VIN, mileage, service status, etc.)

Track service dates and odometer readings

Book common services such as:

Oil change / inspection

Tyre replacement

Brake inspection

Battery replacement

Engine overhaul

Towing requests

Submit service requests directly through the app

Prevent incorrect bookings by enforcing single service selection

The goal is to remove confusion and guesswork around car maintenance and create a digital service book for your vehicle.
